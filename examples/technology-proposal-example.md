## 2. Solution Architecture

### High-Level Architecture
```
Frontend (React/Next.js) → API Gateway → Microservices (Node.js/Express)
                                     ↓
Load Balancer → Container Orchestration (Kubernetes) → Database Cluster (PostgreSQL)
                                     ↓
Cache Layer (Redis) → Message Queue (RabbitMQ) → External APIs
```

### Technology Stack Recommendation
- **Frontend**: React 18 with Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js microservices
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 with read replicas
- **Cache**: Redis for session and data caching
