## üîÑ In Progress

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Create `.env.local` file with required variables
- [ ] Set up MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- [ ] Generate and configure NEXTAUTH_SECRET
- [ ] Test application startup

## ‚ùå Remaining Tasks

### Immediate Setup (Required to run app)
- [ ] **Create `.env.local` file** in project root
- [ ] **Install MongoDB** (local via Docker/Homebrew or Atlas cloud)
- [ ] **Configure MongoDB URI** in environment variables
- [ ] **Generate secure NEXTAUTH_SECRET** using openssl
- [ ] **Test application startup** with `pnpm dev`

### Authentication Setup (Optional but recommended)
- [ ] Set up Google OAuth credentials
- [ ] Configure Google Cloud Console project
- [ ] Add Google OAuth environment variables
- [ ] Test Google sign-in functionality

### Email Authentication (Optional)
- [ ] Configure email server settings
- [ ] Set up Gmail app password
- [ ] Add email environment variables
- [ ] Test email sign-in functionality

### Stripe Integration (Optional)
- [ ] Create Stripe account
- [ ] Get API keys from Stripe dashboard
- [ ] Configure webhook endpoints
- [ ] Add Stripe environment variables
- [ ] Test subscription functionality

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test user registration/sign-in
- [ ] Test pitch deck generation
- [ ] Test proposal generation
- [ ] Verify MongoDB data persistence
- [ ] Test subscription limits and usage tracking

### Production Readiness
- [ ] Update environment variables for production
- [ ] Configure production MongoDB connection
- [ ] Set up production domain in NextAuth
- [ ] Configure production Stripe keys
- [ ] Set up production email service

## üö® Critical Path

To get the application running immediately, you need to complete these tasks in order:

1. **Create `.env.local`** with MongoDB URI and NextAuth secret
2. **Start MongoDB** (local or cloud)
3. **Test startup** with `pnpm dev`

## üìù Notes

- The application will now provide clear error messages if environment variables are missing
- MongoDB is required for the application to function (user data, documents, subscriptions)
- NextAuth secret is required for session management and security
- Google OAuth and email authentication are optional but enhance user experience
- Stripe integration is optional but required for subscription management features

## üîß Quick Commands

```bash
# Generate secure secret
openssl rand -base64 32

# Start local MongoDB with Docker
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo:latest

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```
